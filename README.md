ACE IT provides two-factor authentication for students and educators by directly connecting to their university accounts. Students and educators can improve their time-management and efficiency by scheduling class meetings, events, and office hour appointments all in one place. ACE IT focuses on improving online interactions with features like chat rooms, interactive whiteboards, screen-sharing, and code-sharing to engage students within the virtual classroom. The design of ACE IT enables students to check educator availability and schedule 1-on-1 appointments when they require extra help.
